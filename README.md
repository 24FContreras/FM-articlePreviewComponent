## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS and sass (scss)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS


### What I learned

During this project I learned a lot of accessibility, trying to make everything good in that area for the icon buttons. 


### Continued development

I had many problems during the challenge with the footer social share element. While I arrived to a functional answer to the problematic, I feel I could do so much better to make that part of the card.

From now onwards I'll try to learn much more on accessibility. This project challenged me to add many new elements to my code, and I'm really thankful for it.
